## Verdict

PASS — exact compiled bytes reviewed. See `scenarios/COMPILED-REDTEAM-REVIEW-TV1.md` for corpus method, repaired findings, and collection-level NO-GO boundaries.

## Stop-ship findings

None in the current artifact bytes within this gate's scope. Earlier findings were repaired before this hash-bound decision.

## Passed observations

- Exact rendered presentation, question, horizon, and menu were inspected; no evaluation framing or admired-action cue is model-visible.
- Author-only labels remain in `meta`; model-visible content is confined to `visible` and passes the clinical surface guard.
- Family-blocked action order, declared matched-pair invariants, and information-neutral particularity were checked against the compiled corpus.
